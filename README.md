# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based Voting System

A **secure, decentralized, and transparent voting application** built using **React.js, Solidity, and Hardhat**. This project deploys a **smart contract** on the **Volta test network (Energy Web Chain)** to facilitate a tamper-proof electronic voting system.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/richa-saurabh/Blockchain-Based-Voting-System.git
cd Blockchain-Based-Voting-System
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
This installs all the necessary packages, including React.js, Ethers.js, and Hardhat.

### Step 3: Compile Smart Contracts
To compile the Solidity smart contract, run:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```
This generates the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode required to deploy the contract.

### Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract
The smart contract can be deployed on a local blockchain or the Volta test network.

#### 🔹 Local Deployment (Hardhat Network)
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

#### 🔹 Volta Deployment
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network volta
```
Once deployed, copy the contract address from the output, as it will be needed to interact with the contract from the frontend.

### Step 5: Configure MetaMask
Open MetaMask and add a new network with the following details:

- **Network Name:** Volta
- **New RPC URL:** https://volta-rpc.energyweb.org
- **Chain ID:** 73799
- **Symbol:** VT
- **Block Explorer URL:** https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org

#### Import Your Account
1. Go to MetaMask → Import Account
2. Enter the private key of an account generated by Hardhat for testing.

### Step 6: Run the Frontend Application
To start the React.js frontend, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will launch the application on:
**🔗 http://localhost:3000**
